## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find:

- **EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis projects where I explore and visualize datasets to gain insights.
- **ML:** Machine Learning projects including regression, classification, and clustering tasks.
- **DL:** Deep Learning projects covering neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.

Feel free to explore the projects and assignments!
