# CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing and analyzing structured grid data, such as images and video. CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision and have become the state-of-the-art approach for various tasks, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and more. Here's why CNNs are important and widely used in data science:

### ***Feature Learning:***
- CNNs automatically learn hierarchical representations of features directly from raw input data.
- They use convolutional layers to detect patterns and features at different levels of abstraction, starting from simple edges and textures to complex shapes and objects.
- This hierarchical feature learning capability allows CNNs to effectively capture and understand the underlying structure of the data, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification and object recognition.
### ***Translation Invariance:***
- CNNs exploit the spatial locality and translational invariance of data by using shared weights and local connectivity.
- This allows them to recognize patterns and objects regardless of their position or orientation in the input data.
- For example, a CNN can correctly identify an object in an image even if it appears in different locations or at different scales.
### ***Parameter Efficiency:***
- CNNs are parameter-efficient compared to fully connected networks because they use shared weights in convolutional layers.
- By sharing weights, CNNs reduce the number of parameters in the model, making them easier to train and less prone to overfitting, especially when dealing with large input data like images.
### ***Hierarchical Representation:***
- CNNs naturally encode hierarchical representations of data, with lower layers capturing low-level features and higher layers capturing more abstract and complex features.
- This hierarchical representation enables CNNs to effectively model the hierarchical structure of data and extract meaningful features at multiple levels of abstraction.
### ***Versatility and Generalization:***
- CNNs can be adapted and applied to a wide range of tasks in computer vision, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, facial recognition, medical image analysis, and more.
- Their versatility and ability to generalize well to diverse datasets make them indispensable tools in various domains, from healthcare and autonomous vehicles to entertainment and security.

## TensorFlow
* TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by **Google Brain Team**. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and resources for building and deploying machine learning models.
* TensorFlow provides high-level APIs like `Keras` and `TensorFlow Estimators` for building and training models with ease

## Keras
- Keras is an open-source high-level neural networks API written in Python and designed for fast experimentation with deep learning models.
- Originally developed by `Fran√ßois Chollet`, Keras aims to be user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for building, training, and deploying deep learning models.
- Keras supports both `convolutional` and `recurrent neural networks` and combinations of these architectures.
