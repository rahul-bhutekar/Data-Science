# Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict the final grade (`G3`) of secondary school students based on various attributes related to their personal, familial, and academic backgrounds. The dataset used for this project is the Student Performance dataset, which includes information on students' demographics, parental background, school-related factors, lifestyle, and academic performance.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the final grade (`G3`) of students. The project involves the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data preprocessing
4. Model building and evaluation
5. Model deployment (optional)

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to explore the data and understand the relationships between features. Some of the visualizations include:

- Histograms
- Box plots
- Correlation heatmaps
- Scatter plots

## Model Building
We build and evaluate various regression models, including:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regression
4. Gradient Boosting Regression
5. Support Vector Regressor

We use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the models using metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score
